`11:53`    I am back, I needed a moment with the lord.

`12:24` this video is wrapping up, will be jumping int this controller soon.

`1:08` : going to take a break, i need a shower
=============================================\

`2:53` I guess the next thing to do is get this employee index to work

`3:00` Wow that was quick, I got tthe employee index to wrok pretty fast. I guess I just need to watch my naming conventions more

`3:05` holy moley, that same fix also saved the service index! sometimes you get lucky i guess 

`3:26` I am in the middle of writting my client model into the app. I should do a migration soon

`3:33` : once again, I made a view work, I now have a working Client model view controller working. now to give everything CRUD. oh boy...


`4:00` Employee create route is working !

`4:19` researching tehh rest of the crud methods

`4:45` : still researching

`5:12` made the Create route for clients and services

`5:45` creating instances of these objects is turning out to be a problem

`6:26` i am so tired of dealing with this wall i cant break

`6:51` dude it wasnt working because I am super dumb, it just didnt know what to do with the rest od the info in with the one to one relathinship


`7:07` sweet jesus in heaven I cant belive I am actually making progress again. I forgot that home index also hada controller I should have updated!

`7:54` after reading more about User authentication, i might go to bed and pick this up tommorrow morning
=============================================================\

`6:29` So it turns out I had a few migrations pending, wich was causeing a mess with my foreign key constraints in the SQL schema. I fixed it! I think I actually have a many to many with services-employees, and a one to many with clients-services!

`6:46` researching, I get the feeling I am getting this error, because of my relationships. Service might have to be associated witha  client

`7:30` still researching. I think y services and my calendar can be one in the same.
